# Dibujillo

Dibujillo is an online multiplayer drawing/guessing game, where each player one by one, draws a given word and the rest of the player have to guess what the word is.

## Where to play it?

Dibujillo can be played [here](https://dibujillo.herokuapp.com/).
In order to play a game, you have to join an already existing room or create a new one. The game will then automatically start as soon as enough players are in the room (2 by default).

## Why the lack of commits/organization?

The game was made by me a couple of years ago as a way to learn/improve Websockets, online multiplaying, RTC (Real Time Communication), etc.
At the time, it was just a fun side project with no defined goal. I managed to recover the game, but git was missing, that's why it doesn't have any commits aside from the ones after it being completed.
